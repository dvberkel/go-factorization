Go Factorization
================

This is the [factorization kata][1] in [go][2].

The intent is to get to know [go][2] better.

Getting Started
---------------

We assume a working [go environment][3]

The go documentation explains [workspaces][4]. In one of your
workspaces execute the following command

    go get github.com/dvberkel/go-factorization

This will clone the go-factorization repository from GitHub.
